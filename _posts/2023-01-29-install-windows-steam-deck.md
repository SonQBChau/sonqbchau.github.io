Installing Windows or Ubuntu on an external USB drive is a great way to save your Steam Deck storage, especially if you have the 64GB version. This guide provides instructions for installing either operating system on your Steam Deck.

## Windows Installation

To run Windows from an USB drive, you'll need to use Windows to Go as standard versions cannot be installed on external drives. An SSD is also recommended as HDD is slow. Download the [Windows 11 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11) from Microsoft's website, and [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to create Windows to Go image option.

Once you have both the Windows ISO and Rufus, follow these steps:

1. Open Rufus and select the external USB drive as the target device.
2. Choose the Windows 11 ISO as the source.
3. In the Partition scheme section, select "MBR partition scheme for BIOS or UEFI computer."
4. Choose NTFS as the file system.
5. In the Boot selection section, select Windows to Go.
6. Click the Start button in Rufus to begin the process.
7. Once Rufus finishes, you can install Windows 11 by pressing the volume and power button on your Steam Deck and selecting the USB drive as the boot option.

**Dual Boot**

If you want to dual boot Windows 11 and SteamOS on your Steam Deck, the process is a little more involved. You can refer to [Steamdeck Ultimate Windows 11 Guide](https://github.com/baldsealion/Steamdeck-Ultimate-Windows11-Guide/wiki).

## Ubuntu Installation

If you install Ubuntu the normal way, it will prompted to select boot options every time you start up your Steam Deck. To avoid this issue, you can disable the ESP flag during the installation process. Here are the steps:

- Create a live USB Ubuntu by downloading [Ubuntu ISO](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) and [Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
- Plug both live USB and the empty drive into Steam Deck
- Boot into Ubuntu by holding volume button and power button
- Choose try Ubuntu
- Open GParted, find the partition flagged as ESP, click on manage flags and disable it. (step by step details here [Install Ubuntu on USB](https://itsfoss.com/intsall-ubuntu-on-usb/))
- Once removed, select "Install Ubuntu" on the desktop
- Skip wifi setup and choose "Minimal installation", then "Something else"
- Choose the correct external drive for "Device for bootloader installation" (for example /dev/sda)
- On this drive, clicking the â€“ button to delete any existing partitions
- Select + button to create partition for ESP, set size 500 MB and use as "EFI System Partition"
- Create the remaining free space with Ext4 filesystem with mount point "/"
- When the installation finishes, click "Continue Testing" and re-enable ESP flags in GParted.

Your Steam Deck still boots into SteamOS the way it does, and Ubuntu only shows up in the Boot Manager if you plug in the external drive.

**Removing Ubuntu from BIOS Boot Menu (UEFI)**

If you mistakenly added Ubuntu to the boot menu in your BIOS or UEFI, you can find how to remove it .

```bash
sudo efibootmgr
# Then delete the option you don't want. In this example, Ubuntu is entry 0.
sudo efibootmgr -b 0 -B 
```

*NOTE: I found that Steam Deck update can cause issues with booting Ubuntu. In this case, simply use the command above to remove Ubuntu option and then restart should fix it.*
